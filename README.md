Why did the computer go to the doctor?
Because it had a virus! üòÇ

I am Lasma, coming from a background in the business world, and I am ready to embark on a new journey in IT. 
With a strong desire to learn, actively collaborate, and grow alongside fellow women in tech, I bring enthusiasm and determination to every challenge. 
Joining this group promises to boost my energy and accelerate my skills, ensuring mutual success and empowerment.

I'm Triin. This is my introcotion place holder. :) TESTING: This sentence is added on Triin's local machine by just opening the file on my computer with Visual Studio Code and saving it, later planning to use the Github Desktop app to "push" this change to guthub so that all of the team members can see it.

Hello! I am Liisa, my daily work background is in retail and purchase work, product assortment and analysis etc. I also want to start a new career. The IT field seems so big and broad that maybe I can fit in too.
